# Mixed Messages
## Introduction
This is a Project suggested in the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer path course. The aim of this project is mostly learn to work in a developer's environment and getting used to Git and Github. This app runs in the terminal and it's a very simple javascript app. Every time you run it, it generates a radom sentence. Each sentence is made up of four parts: subject, verb, object and prepositional phrase.

## Technologies
* Javascript
* Command line
* Node js

## Launch

To use this app it's best to have basic knowledge of the command line, and node js. Then you can download just the mixed-messages.js file. If you have windows you must have git Bash installed. For any OS download and install Node js.

1. Open the terminal on the directory you have the file.
2. Then just type: Node mixed-messages.js.
3. You'll get a random message any time you type it. (quick tip: copy and paste it to get the sentences quicker.)

If you feel adventurous you can change and/or add verbs, objects and prepositional phrases.
